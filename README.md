# AlexNet
Integration of AlexNet (in ONNX format) into modelhub.ai

This integration is based on release 1.1 from https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/bvlc_alexnet. 

NOTE: The orginal instructions for preprocessing and postprocessing were not sufficient/correct (at the time we did the integration). We did our best to implement proper processing, and results look ok, but they might not be optimal.
